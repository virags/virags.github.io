== About Me
Starting Jan 2016, I am Postdoctoral researcher at [http://www.msr-inria.fr Microsoft Research - Inria Joint center] at Palaiseau, France, hosted by [http://www.msr-inria.fr/researchers/laurent-massoulie/ Dr. Laurent Massoulie], [http://www.di.ens.fr/~lelarge/ Dr. Mark Lelarge], and [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/milanv/ Dr. Milan Vojnovic].

Prior to this, I was Simons Postdoctoral Fellow at UT Austin hosted by [http://www.ma.utexas.edu/users/baccelli/ Prof. Francois Baccelli] in fall of 2015.

I obtained my PhD at [http://www.utexas.edu/ The University of Texas at Austin] in August 2015 under supervision of [http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~gustavo/ Prof. Gustavo de Veciana]. 

I have also held research positions at [https://www.bell-labs.com/ Bell Labs] New Jersey, [http://www.iitb.ac.in/ Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay], and [http://www.iisc.ac.in/ Indian Institute of Science (IISc) Bangalore].

== Research Interests 

- System optimization and algorithm design for scalable cloud computing systems
- Applied queueing theory
- Machine learning algorithms suitable for dynamic machine-human interactions

One of my main research interests is to identify fundamental resource bottlenecks in cloud computing/content delivery infrastructure and design algorithms which optimally use these constrained resources. The goal is that, eventually, cloud resource consumption practices would become less wasteful than as they are today.  

Recently, I am also exploring alternate paradigms for machine learning, with particular focus on applications which interact dynamically with human consumers, eg., online Q&A platforms, crowdsourcing, hiring platforms, etc. The aim is to design an automated framework which efficiently learns (and `unlearnsâ€™) the evolving patterns. 


Below is a talk in which I show that significant gains can be achieved by pooling of server resources in centralized content delivery systems. The talk was given at [https://www.lincs.fr/ LINCS] lab in Paris.
