My main research focus is to identify fundamental resource bottlenecks in cloud computing and content delivery infrastructure, and to design algorithms which optimally use these constrained resources. The goal is that, eventually, cloud resource consumption practices would become less wasteful than as they are today. 


A key challenge in these systems is to understand the impact of dynamic 
interactions of diverse jobs on user performance as the system’s size and load scale. A better understanding here allows us to design better algorithms which scale well under stochastic loads. This is a chicken and egg problem. Algorithms impact system dynamics, which we study in order to design new algorithms, and so on, until everything falls into place. 

 
Here is a talk in which I show that significant gains can be achieved in centralized content delivery systems via a combination of pooling of server resources and fairness based load balancing. The talk was given at [https://www.lincs.fr/ LINCS] lab in Paris. 

== Active learning for Online Matching Markets
Recently, I have been exploring resource allocation problems for two sided markets, focusing on applications where humans are involved in providing better solutions to jobs, eg., online Q&A platforms, crowdsourcing, hiring platforms, etc. The goal is to ensure efficient utilization of the valuable human resources. This requires an agile framework which efficiently learns the evolving patterns of the interests and skills of the human experts to match them to right jobs


Classical machine learning algorithms for such applications estimate parameters such as interests, demands, capabilities, etc.\ of human consumers from the data collected in the past. Such algorithms are often `frozen in time’ in that they view the parameters as being static while making decisions. 
Instead, we use queues to track histories of different users. We let the gradients obtained via queue lengths drive the decision making. Since queues are inherently dynamic, such an approach could be more suitable for above applications.
