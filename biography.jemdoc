(Needs Work!!!)

Starting Jan 2016, I am Postdoctoral researcher at [http://www.msr-inria.fr Microsoft Research - Inria Joint center] at Palaiseau, France, hosted by [http://www.msr-inria.fr/researchers/laurent-massoulie/ Dr. Laurent Massoulie], [http://www.di.ens.fr/~lelarge/ Dr. Mark Lelarge], and [http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/people/milanv/ Dr. Milan Vojnovic.]

I obtained my PhD at [http://www.utexas.edu/ The University of Texas at Austin] in August 2015 under advice of [http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~gustavo/ Prof. Gustavo de Veciana]. We developed algorithms and performance analysis for centralized content delivery infrastructure. In fall of 2015, I was Simons Postdoc Fellow at UT Austin hosted by [http://www.ma.utexas.edu/users/baccelli/ Prof. Francois Baccelli]. We provided new queueing models for analyzing performance in cloud computing systems. In summer of 2013, I was at [https://www.bell-labs.com/ Bell Labs], (now Nokia Bell Labs) where I worked with [https://www.bell-labs.com/researchers/180/ Dr. T. V. Lakshman] and [https://www.bell-labs.com/researchers/174/ Dr. Murali Kodialam]. At Bell Labs I was involved in developing protocols for content storage and delivery in data centers for low latency.

Before coming to the West, I worked at two top research institutes in India, namely, [http://www.iitb.ac.in/ Indian Institute of Technology (IIT) Bombay], and [http://www.iisc.ac.in/ Indian Institute of Science (IISc) Bangalore]. In 2010, I was Research Fellow at IIT Bombay. I worked with [http://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/~dmanju/ Prof. D. Manjunath] and [http://www.ee.iitb.ac.in/wiki/faculty/bikash Prof. Bikash K. Dey] and designed fast algorithms for in-network function computations. I obtained my Masters degree in Telecommunication from IISc, Bangalore, India in July 2009  under advise of [http://www.ece.iisc.ernet.in/~nbmehta/ Prof. Neelesh B. Mehta]. We developed distributed algorithms for wireless cooperative relay selection.
